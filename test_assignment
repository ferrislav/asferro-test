Test challenge
QA-automation engineer

Stack: 
    • Language: Python / JavaScript / Java (depends on position requirements)
    • Web-Driver: Selenium / Puppeteer (depends on position requirements)
    • Test framework: up to you

Write a test using defined language, framework and web-driver that should perform next steps:

    1. Login to any email box.
    2. Send from 10 mails from current box to yourself with:
        ◦ Theme: Random string with 10 symbols (letters and numbers only)
        ◦ Body: Random string with 10 symbols (letters and numbers only)
    3. Check that all 10 mails are delivered.
    4. Collect data from all incoming mails and save it as Object (Dictionary), where:
        ◦ Key is theme of mail
        ◦ Value is body of mail
    5. Send collected data to yourself as: “Received mail on theme {Theme} with message: {Body}. It contains {Count of letters} letters and {Count of numbers} numbers” (repeat for each mail).
    6. Delete all received mails except the last one.

    1. Do not use auto-generated selectors
    2. Use testing patterns
    3. Script should be autonomous, without hardcoded settings and paths
    4. requiremnts.txt (for Python)

    2. Assertion libraries
    3. README included with instructions for running
